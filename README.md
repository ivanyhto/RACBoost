## Abstract
Modern machine learning techniques such as gradient boosting and neural networks are not designed to handle data from discrete choice events directly. In this paper, we proposed a stage-wise gradient descent gradient boosting model for the conditional logit model. We explored augmenting the features between iterations with a neural network while regularising the complexity of the model. The methodology proposed is applied to the Hong Kong Horse Racing market. We show in experiments that the methodology can provide estimates that are stable to pre-processing. It outperformed tradition discrete choice models and previous related work.
